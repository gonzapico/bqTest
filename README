In this document we are going to write out the documentation of the app.

- LoginActivity
In this screen we show the user the way to log in into the app. If it's the first time, he/she is logging in into the app, then he has to provide permissions to the app. The only valid accounts are sandbox accounts, not the real ones.

- NoteListActivity
Activity where we get all the notes of the user who has logged in on Evernote and will show them on a list. He/she could change the order of the list with a spinner.
