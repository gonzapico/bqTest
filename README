In this document we are going to write out the documentation of the app.

- LoginActivity
In this screen we show the user the way to log in into the app. If it's the first time, he/she is logging in into the app, then he has to provide permissions to the app. The only valid accounts are sandbox accounts, not the real ones.

- NoteListActivity
Activity where we get all the notes of the user who has logged in on Evernote and will show them on a list. He/she could change the order of the list with a spinner. 

- NoteActivity
Activity to show the content of the note that the user wants to see.

- CreateNoteActivity
Activity to create a new note and show it when you're getting back of the list of notes.
